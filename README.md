# Earthquake Monitor

## Description 
* This Earthquake Monitor app will display live earthquake data of the ten most recent earthquakes of both California and a searched zip code. It will also provide recent California earthquake news, and will sort the recent earthquakes by magnitude for a user to view for California and for a searched zip code.

## User Story
* WHEN the Earthquake Monitor page loads
* THEN I am presented with the ten most recent California earthquakes, earthquake news, and the recent earthquakes will be sorted by magnitude. 
* WHEN I enter a zip code, within California
* THEN I am presented with the ten most recent California earthquakes, earthquake news for the area, within a 100 mile radius, and the recent earthquakes for that area will be sorted by magnitude. 
* IF there are no recent earthquakes within a 100 mile radius of the searched area
* THEN I am given an alert that "No recent earthquakes have happened within 100 miles of your zip code."
* AFTER performing a zip code search
* THEN I am presented with my search history, or can otherwise perform a new zip code search to find the recent ten earthquakes for that area.
